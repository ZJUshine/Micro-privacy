5683-32866-0022,ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FADED TAPESTRY
5683-32866-0023,ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGED TO OTHER TIMES
5683-32866-0025,I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
5683-32866-0026,I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY CHEROOT
5683-32866-0027,A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028,THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HEARSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029,SOMEHOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030,A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
5683-32865-0000,YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LAKE
5683-32865-0001,SAID LORD CHELFORD ADDRESSING ME

5683-32865-0006,AT DINNER LAKE WAS EASY AND AMUSING
5683-32865-0007,I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WYLDER CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32865-0008,I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
5683-32865-0011,WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
5683-32865-0013,DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
5683-32865-0014,HE'S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
5683-32865-0015,I HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
5683-32865-0016,OH I KNOW THAT'S LORNE BRANDON
5683-32865-0017,ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LAKE
1284-1181-0000,OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
1284-1181-0002,THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003,THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
1284-1181-0005,NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0007,SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
1284-1181-0015,MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0018,IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
1284-1181-0019,I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
1284-1181-0021,ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS

1188-133604-0017,THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS

1188-133604-0042,THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
2830-3980-0000,IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001,THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
2830-3980-0002,HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST
2830-3980-0003,PAUL CAME LATER AND IS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004,INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0008,PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009,PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0011,PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012,THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013,HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014,THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015,FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016,IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017,WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0018,I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0020,THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021,AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022,THE CLAUSE SEEMS SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0024,IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0026,VERSE TWO
2830-3980-0027,AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028,THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
2830-3980-0033,NOT ALL THE GALATIANS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034,THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED
2830-3980-0035,THEY REMAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0038,GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0040,THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041,GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042,THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043,EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
2830-3980-0044,HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045,MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046,WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0049,EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0052,WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053,AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0058,MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059,PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060,HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE
2830-3980-0061,NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASCHAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062,NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063,UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064,HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS
2830-3980-0068,THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0070,BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071,WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
2830-3980-0072,THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
2830-3980-0075,BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076,ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2830-3979-0002,LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
2830-3979-0004,IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
2830-3979-0005,THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED
2830-3979-0006,A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
2830-3979-0010,BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE
2830-3979-0012,THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
2830-3980-0000,IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001,THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
2830-3980-0002,HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST
2830-3980-0003,PAUL CAME LATER AND IS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004,INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0008,PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009,PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0011,PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012,THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013,HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014,THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015,FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016,IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017,WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0018,I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0020,THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021,AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022,THE CLAUSE SEEMS SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0024,IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0026,VERSE TWO
2830-3980-0027,AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028,THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
2830-3980-0033,NOT ALL THE GALATIANS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034,THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED
2830-3980-0035,THEY REMAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0038,GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0040,THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041,GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042,THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043,EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
2830-3980-0044,HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045,MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046,WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0049,EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0052,WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053,AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0058,MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059,PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060,HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE
2830-3980-0061,NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASCHAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062,NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063,UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064,HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS
2830-3980-0068,THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0070,BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071,WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
2830-3980-0072,THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
2830-3980-0075,BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076,ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2830-3979-0002,LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
2830-3979-0004,IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
2830-3979-0005,THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED
2830-3979-0006,A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
2830-3979-0010,BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE
2830-3979-0012,THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
6829-68771-0003,THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0011,TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0014,WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENDANTS BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015,WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS
6829-68771-0017,THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BETH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0020,THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PARSONS

6829-68771-0027,THEY THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028,SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0031,HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS
6829-68771-0034,I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035,WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036,ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
6829-68769-0002,I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER
6829-68769-0003,IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0007,BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008,FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY JAIL

6829-68769-0023,I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID

6829-68769-0027,WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHECK ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0028,HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0029,IT'S A STOCK COMPANY AND RICH
6829-68769-0030,I WAS BOOKKEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031,AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED THEM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
